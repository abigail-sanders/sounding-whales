				 <h3>Glacier Bay May 2020</h3>
				 <p> This is a transcription of a whale song recorded in May 2020 in the Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska, provided to me by a scientist there.  It is very unsual because humpbakcs do not normally sing until the fall, and it was recorded while the oceans was unprecedentally quiet due to the corona pandemic. It became a piece for solo french horn.</p>

				 <h3> Glacier Bay Nov 2020 </h3>
				 <p> This is a graphic score I made of the a whale song recorded in November 2020 in the Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska.  The original can be heard on their website.  This became a duo for horns and percussion with electronics. <p>
